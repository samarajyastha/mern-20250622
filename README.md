## Virtual DOM

- Light weight copy or real DOM
- Whenever state changes:
    - React updates the virtual DOM
    - Compares with the previous DOM (Diffing)
    - Updates only the changed parts in the Real DOM (Reconciliation)
- Faster rendering
- Better performance

## Component 

- UI block
- Reusable
- Functional Component, Class Component
- Stateful component: State/UI can be updated
- Stateless component: State can be updated, UI cannot be changed.
- Hooks

## Hooks

- Special function
- It enables us to make functional component stateful.
- Using hooks, we can implement state management in Functional component.

1. useState
2. useEffect
3. useRef
4. Custom hooks

## State

- Object (mutable/changeable)
- State is updated on user interaction, event triggers or API calls

## JSX

- JS/HTML code
